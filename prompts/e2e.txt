Please read the following paragraphs, find all the nano-composite samples, and then fill out the given JSON template for each one of those nanocomposite samples. If there are multiple Filler Composition Mass/Volume for a unique set of Matrix/Filler Chemical Name, please give a list for the Composition. If an attribute is not mentioned in the paragraphs fill that section with "null". Mass and Volume Composition should be followed by a %.
